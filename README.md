    -Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
    They wanted to enxpand on their game  draw it or lose it, expanding to multiple platforms, and increasing their user base.
    
    -What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
    I believe that I wrote it in a way that makes sense, and takes into consideration the clients time and budget while delivering on their end goal.
    
    -What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
    It allowed me to be able to reflect on what functionality  the client wanted overall in order to better serve their needs/requirements.
    
    -If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    The beginnning of the document, or Project 1, as later my knowledge base changed and I could make a more informed decision.
    
    -How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    Overall  their needs seemed to be well explained, so I chose a solution that fit exactly what they were looking for. Overall chooseing a linux based web server to handle all their server side for the application, with a low overhead cost, and using AWS it allows them to spin up more servers on demand, which is something they had not considered.
    -How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
    Overall writing clean and efficient code, that allowed me to meet the clients requests. This allowed us to create a very useful UML Diagram that explained many of the attributes being used to either define a class, or passed into a different function. Overall this allowed me to design very efficiently and fluently. I would deffinitely design this way again.
